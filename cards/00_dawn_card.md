## Disoriented and Lost
A magical trap was placed somewhere where your players are, and when it went off the players were disoriented by it's affects, and find themselves in another location. This may be a good time to play a location card to find out where they went, unless there is already a place in mind.


LOCATIONS

## Example Location
Location location location. These are places that an NPC, clue, or plot point may direct the players to. Locations are usually played at the end of a scene to start up the next scene in the episode.

## Abandonded Hospital
The walls are ripe with moss and decay, it's super creepy. There are long corridors lined with cots and medical equipment that is way past it's prime. Some Flourescent lights are still on, but flicker sporadically.

_If the players go too far down a hallway, they might encounter renegade punks looking to scavenge equipment, and it might incur an encounter_


THEME
---
## Example Theme
The theme is the overarching plot or task of the episode and is tied to the Boss of the episode, or the Boss of the episode might benefit from a certain outcome.
